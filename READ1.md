## Activity 1: Investigating APIs

Explain API types and the benefits of APIs, and analyse the differences between API and SDK.
first of all lets define the API is a collection of programming code so it will allow data to be transferred between software products also API includes the terms of the data transfer.

types of APIs:
* Partner APIs: 
this API can keep track of how the exposed digital assets are being utilized ensuring that third-party solutions that use their APIs deliver a good user experience and guarantee that corporate identity is maintained in their apps. 


* public APIs that are available to the public.
These APIs, often knownas external APIs are available to all third-party developers When correctly implemented, a public API program provides for increased brand exposure as well as an extra source of money. 

*  private APIs: 
APIs with restricted access, hese application software interfaces are intended to improve an organization's solutions and services. 


## what is the benefits of APIs:

1. service and information delivery we can say is flexible because APIs may access app components

2. APIs make it easier to incorporate information from any website or application.
This ensures more fluid information transmission

3. APIs allow any user or organization to personalize the information and services that they use more

4. APIs assist in the support of unforeseen future uses.
Making data available via API can help with faster and easier data migration as well as better data quality 


### the differences between API and SDK:
so what is an API and SDK so we explained about API so what is SDK:.
As a result, it is a set of software development tools that serve both the frontend and the backend.

+  SDK works best for users who use a programming language supported by the SDK and whose app must operate independently without the usage of a network but The Web API is suitable for those that want a faster implementation
+ APIs are generally lightweight and perform particular functions but SDKs may be we can say large and extensive.
